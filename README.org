* Overview
This project will make existing clustering algorithms available to the
public. Currently clusterol-tool seems to be able to single-link
cluster and not much more. Don't use this for anything at all before
it is in a more complete state.

* Todo
- make clusterol-tool more useful
- actually test it
- make headers more usable and add functionality back in
- documentation
